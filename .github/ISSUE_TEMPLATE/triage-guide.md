# Simple guide: What happens after you send an issue

Important note: This "Issue Tracker" is not official. It will be shared with the team but is community driven.

This short guide explains, in plain language, what happens after you send an issue and how you can help.

What "triage" means
- Triage is the quick first look we give to every new report.
- We check: Is it a real issue? Is it already reported? Who should look at it? How urgent is it?

Common labels (plain words)
- triage — New report, waiting for the first look
- bug — Something is broken
- problem — Something confusing or not working as expected
- feature — A new thing to add
- idea — A small improvement or suggestion
- urgent / high / normal / low — How quickly we should act
- needs-info — We need more details from the person who filed the report

What usually happens after you send a report
1. It gets the “triage” label so our team sees it in the review list.
2. Someone reads it and:
   - Confirms the kind of report (bug / feature / idea).
   - Adds a clear label (for example, bug or feature) and sets how urgent it is.
   - Asks for more information if needed (we’ll say exactly what we need).
   - Assigns it to a person or moves it to our planning board.
3. After a first review, the "triage" label is removed.

How you can help
- Add a short title and one-sentence summary.
- If you can, add steps and a screenshot — those help a lot.
- Say where you saw it (website, app, page name).
- If you find something similar, add a link to that report.

If we need more from you, we’ll ask with simple, clear steps to help us reproduce or understand the issue.
